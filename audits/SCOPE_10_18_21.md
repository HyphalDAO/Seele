# Seele audit scope as of 10-13-21

This list is in order of importance. The voting strategies don't need to all be audited at the same time.

## Seele.sol

This is the core of Seele, it should be a Zodiac compliant module. This module should contain the following features:
- Must Implement abstract contract Module from Zodiac correctly
- Must register voting strategies through Owner access only (assumed to be the Gnosis Safe for governance activation only)
- Must remove voting strategies through Owner access only
- Must store proposal state correctly (including correct transaction hashing, same as Reality module)
- Must cycle through the Enum states correctly
- Must execute transaction data based on stored hashes correctly (same as Reality module but includes batching)
- Must receive a call from a designtated voting strat to move the proposal into a delay period (if the strat has one)
- May delay transaction exectution if the strat has one
- Must be able to execute transaction in order singly and in batched orders

## BaseTokenVoting.sol

An abstract contract that defines reusable functions that most token based voting strats need. `calculateWeight()` is overridden by most strategies to accomplish different logic for voting weights.
- Must be able to register voting period length
- Must be able to register quorum threshold
- Must be able to register a delay on execution after passing in Seele if necessary
- Must implement EIP712 correctly for off-chain voting signatures

## BaseStrategy.sol

An abstract contract that provides the most basic interface that strategies are expected to implement.
- Must be factory freindly allowing strats to be proxy deployable
- Must be able to setSeele (All strats must designate which proposal core they extend, access controlled by Owner/Safe)
- Must implement receiveProposal (All strats must be able to receive a call from Seele proposal core to start the strategy)
- Must implement finalizeStrategy (All strats must be able to call back to the Seele proposal core after the strategy completes) This must send any delay time to the Seele core if there is to be a delay on execution.
- Must implement isPassed (All strats must only be able to call back to the Seele core if this function returns true)

## BaseMember.sol

## OZLinearVoting.sol

A voting strat that uses [OpenZeppelins governance token](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol) extension to achieve Compound like governance.

- Must be able to use ERC20Votes extension correctly
- Must not be able to double vote by using checkpoint from token contract
- Must be able to delegate votes correctly (self or others)
- Must collect votes linearly correctly

## MemberLinearVoting.sol

Simply addes a membership gate to the OZLinearVoting.sol

- Must not be able to vote if not member assigned

## SimpleMemberVoting.sol

This is a non-token based voting strategy. This simply checks that an account is a member and assigns a value of 1 as the weight.

## MemberQuadraticVoting.sol

This is a membership gated token strategy that also scales the delegated weight of tokens down quadratically

- Must take a token delegation balance and return the square root of the balance in `calculateWeight`.
